# Michael Hackett's Personal Website

## Description

This is a personal site that I've created for myself using the **Django** framework in **Python** with the **Bulma** CSS framework to make it look nice. I've published all my code and online for others who are interested in some web dev! Feel free to reach out for documentation on any of the frameworks used, but their documentation is widely available here : [Django](<https://www.djangoproject.com>), [Bulma](<https://bulma.io>)

## Dependencies

Creation in computer science is done by individuals who stand on the shoulders of giants. This project would not be possible without the vast community of individuals who helped contribute to the Django and Bulma frameworks, and I want to also give thanks to the creator of [Bulmaswatch](<https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/>) for some great theme modifications.
